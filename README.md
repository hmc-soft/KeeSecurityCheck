# KeeSecurityCheck
Plugin for KeePass 2 to perform a security audit of your passwords.

## Install
Download the installer from https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=C44FF05A6BA7EAD0!612&authkey=!AOQ7Vr_H2xwE1u0&ithint=file%2cexe

If you don't want to run the installer (because you're paranoid) you can extract the dll from the installer using 7zip.

Alternative install methods may be available in a future release.

## Usage
The plugin adds a new menu item under Tools > Security Check into KeePass.

The auditor will launch in a new window and you can play with the options then click "Run Check" to check your passwords.
